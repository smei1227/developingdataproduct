# developingdataproduct
This is the Week 3 assignment in Develop Data Product course at Coursera. 

Instructions

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
Review criterialess 
The rubric contains the following two questions:

Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?
Example Submissionsless 
Here's an extremely minimal passing example, but we hope your submission is much cooler!

My assignment created a simplty interactive plot using plotly function. Using `mtcars` dataset, a interactive boxplot showed the relationship of mileage per gallon(`mpg`) with cyclinders(`cyl`), transmission(`am`), weight(`wt`), or horse power(`hp`).
